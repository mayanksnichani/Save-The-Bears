# Save-The-Bears
"Save the Bears" is an engaging 2D endless runner game in which you control an iceberg drifting through the Arctic while managing its melting rate. You aim to keep the iceberg from melting too quickly by collecting power-ups and avoiding various obstacles. You'll navigate the treacherous waters, encountering icebergs, plastic waste, and other hazards that can cause your iceberg to shrink. You have access to health and immunity power-ups to aid you in your quest. The game offers an immersive experience with responsive controls, challenging gameplay, and vibrant graphics. It is an entertaining and educational adventure as you help preserve the polar bear's environment and evade climate change threats.
